# im2col.py

## filter_to_2d
filter matrix -> 2d matrix

## data_to_2d
NCHW image matrix -> 2d matrix

## filter2d_to_orig
filter (2d matrix) -> original filter

## data2d_to_orig
image (2d matrix) -> NCHW image matrix

---


to perform convolution: filter2d * data2d

## Test
```sh
$ python im2col.py -v
```
